- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidedesi
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics, Data Science, Movies, Philosophy
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Statistics and Probability
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analytics projects

## Folders:
- __Data Science Projects:__ it contains the Data Science projects listed in this Medium article: https://towardsdatascience.com/5-solved-end-to-end-data-science-projects-in-python-acdc347f36d0. I use this folder to do some exercises and gain experience on building ML models, data visualization and Python data manipulation.

- __Statistics exercises with Python:__ it contains some exercises and quizzes from the "Become a Probability & Statistics Master" (https://www.udemy.com/course/statistics-probability/) course on Udemy and how I completed them using Python.
